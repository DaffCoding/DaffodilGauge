# Daffodil Gauge

The Daffodil Gauge app is a tool designed to help students with their studies. The app will provide a range of features and resources to support different learning styles and needs. 

I plan to create it through the Android Studio IDE.

## Features

Plans of the key features of the Daffodil Gauge app include:

- **Goal setting:** The app will allow users to set study goals and track their progress towards achieving them.

- **Personalized recommendations:** Based on the user's study goals and learning preferences, the app will provide personalized recommendations for study resources, such as books, videos, and online courses.

- **Study tracker:** The app will allow users to track the time they spend studying and provide insights into their study habits and productivity.

- **Collaborative tools:** Users will be able to collaborate with other students, such as forming study groups and sharing notes and resources.
